**Status:** ACTIVE
**Start Date:** 2026-01-06
**Minimum Duration:** 7 Days (Review on/after 2026-01-13)
**Maximum Duration:** 14 Days (Review on 2026-01-20)

## 1. System Configuration (Locked)
*   **Homepage:** Visual Legacy Design + GSC Priority 1 Metadata (Contractor Intent).
*   **Sitemap:** `sitemap-machine.xml` (Static, strictly curated, High-Signal Matrix only).
*   **Service Area:** `/service-area` (Schema-backed Entity Definition).
*   **Adjacency:** Programmatic strict linking via `city-service-router.php` and `home.php`.

## 2. Success Signals (What to Watch)
Do not react to daily noise. Look for these trends over 7 days:

### A. Query Consolidation
*   **Goal:** Fewer queries per page, but higher relevance.
*   **Signal:** `siding contractor south bend` queries clustering strictly on the Homepage and South Bend City Page, stopping the "cannibalization" across random blog posts.

### B. Position Compression
*   **Goal:** Core execution units moving up together.
*   **Target:** City Pages entering **Positions 8-15**.
*   **Target:** Costs Wedge moving steadily toward **Position 12**.

### C. Impression Redistribution
*   **Goal:** Homepage impression share should *narrow* to brand/broad terms.
*   **Signal:** City page impression share should *increase* for geo-specific terms.

## 3. Freeze Exit Criteria
**DO NOT BREAK FREEZE** until **ONE** of the following occurs:

1.  [ ] A City Page (SB, Plymouth, Warsaw, Granger) crosses **Average Position ~10**.
2.  [ ] The Costs Page crosses **Average Position ~12**.
3.  [ ] Total Impressions scale **2x** without significant rank loss (Authority Consolidation).
