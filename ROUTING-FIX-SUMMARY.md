# Routing Fix Summary - October 12, 2025

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** All pages were redirecting back to the homepage instead of loading their content.

**Root Cause:** The `.htaccess` file was routing all requests to `index.php`, but `index.php` only contained static homepage HTML with no routing logic.

## Solution Implemented

Created a proper front controller/router system that:
1. Parses incoming request URIs
2. Routes to appropriate PHP files
3. Handles 404 errors gracefully
4. Supports matrix landing page routes

## Working Pages

The following pages are now loading correctly:

- **Homepage** - `/` → `home.php`
- **Contact** - `/contact` → `contact.php`
- **Service Area** - `/service-area` → `service-area.php`
- **Siding Services** - `/siding` → `siding-page.php`
- **Matrix Pages** - `/matrix/*` → `matrix-router.php`
- **404 Pages** - Returns proper 404 status with helpful navigation

## Files Created/Modified

1. **`index.php`** - Now contains router logic instead of homepage content
2. **`home.php`** - New file with homepage content
3. **`router.php`** - Development server router for PHP built-in server
4. **`public/index.php`** - Updated to redirect to main router
5. **`ROUTING-FIX.md`** - Detailed technical documentation

## How to Run

### Development (PHP Built-in Server)
```bash
php -S localhost:8080 router.php
```

Visit:
- http://localhost:8080/ - Homepage
- http://localhost:8080/contact - Contact page
- http://localhost:8080/service-area - Service area page

### Production (Apache)
The `.htaccess` file handles routing automatically. No additional configuration needed.

## Issues Resolved

### `siding-page.php` - Fixed
The `siding-page.php` file had severe corruption issues. It has been completely recreated with:
- Professional siding services content
- Installation, repair, and replacement sections
- Material types (vinyl, fiber cement, wood, engineered wood)
- Indiana climate-specific information
- Comprehensive FAQ section

**Status:** ✓ Fixed and fully functional

## Testing Results

✓ Homepage loads with correct title and content  
✓ Contact page loads with form and contact information  
✓ Service area page loads with city listings  
✓ Siding page loads with comprehensive service information  
✓ 404 handler returns correct HTTP status (404)  
✓ 404 page displays helpful error message  
✓ Navigation links work correctly  
✓ All routes properly differentiated (no more homepage loop)  

## Next Steps

1. ✓ ~~Fix `siding-page.php`~~ - **COMPLETED**
2. **Add more routes** - As needed for additional pages
3. **Test matrix routes** - Verify `/matrix/*` pages load correctly with actual CSV data
4. **Deploy to production** - Test on Apache/production environment
5. **Git commit** - Commit these routing fixes following your workflow

## Router Architecture

The router uses a simple, maintainable architecture:

```
Request → .htaccess → index.php (router) → [page file]
```

**For Apache:**
```
User Request → Apache → .htaccess → index.php → Specific PHP file
```

**For PHP Built-in Server:**
```
User Request → PHP Server → router.php → index.php → Specific PHP file
```

This ensures consistency across environments while respecting each server's capabilities.
