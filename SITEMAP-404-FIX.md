# Sitemap 404 Fix - Completed

## Problem Identified

Google Search Console showed `sitemap-matrix-2.xml` returning a 404 error, even though the file existed and was accessible.

## Root Cause

**Duplicate sitemap files** causing confusion:
- `sitemap-matrix.xml` (PHP) → 10,500 URLs (dynamic)
- `sitemap-matrix-1.xml` (static) → 10,000 URLs
- `sitemap-matrix-2.xml` (static) → 500 URLs

The static files (`-1.xml` and `-2.xml`) were old build artifacts that were manually submitted to Google Search Console but were never referenced in the sitemap index hierarchy.

## Solution Applied

✅ **Removed duplicate static sitemap shards**
- Deleted `public/sitemap-matrix-1.xml`
- Deleted `public/sitemap-matrix-2.xml`
- Kept `sitemap-matrix.php` (dynamically generates all 10,500 URLs)

## Current Sitemap Structure

```
sitemap-index.xml (or sitemap.xml)
├── sitemap-static.xml (static pages)
├── sitemap-matrix.xml (10,500 matrix pages - dynamically generated)
└── sitemap-blog.xml (blog posts)
```

## Next Steps in Google Search Console

1. **Remove the old shard submissions:**
   - Go to Search Console → Sitemaps
   - Remove: `https://www.hoosiercladding.com/sitemap-matrix-1.xml`
   - Remove: `https://www.hoosiercladding.com/sitemap-matrix-2.xml`

2. **Keep these submissions:**
   - `https://www.hoosiercladding.com/sitemap-index.xml` (main index)
   - OR `https://www.hoosiercladding.com/sitemap.xml` (alternative main index)

3. **Wait for Google to re-crawl** (24-48 hours)
   - The 404 errors will disappear
   - All 10,500+ pages will be discovered through the main index

## Why "0 Domains" is Normal

Sitemap **index** files show 0 discovered pages because they're just containers that point to other sitemaps. The actual page counts appear in the child sitemaps:
- `sitemap-static.xml` → pages
- `sitemap-matrix.xml` → 10,500 pages
- `sitemap-blog.xml` → 5 pages

## Verification

After Railway deploys the changes:
```bash
# These should now return 404 (expected)
curl -I https://www.hoosiercladding.com/sitemap-matrix-1.xml
curl -I https://www.hoosiercladding.com/sitemap-matrix-2.xml

# This should return 200 OK with all URLs
curl -I https://www.hoosiercladding.com/sitemap-matrix.xml
```

## Files Changed

- ❌ Deleted: `public/sitemap-matrix-1.xml`
- ❌ Deleted: `public/sitemap-matrix-2.xml`
- ✅ Kept: `sitemap-matrix.php` (dynamic generation)
- ✅ Kept: All other sitemap files

## Commit

```
git commit: "Remove duplicate static sitemap shards - using dynamic PHP generation"
git push: origin/main
Status: Deployed to Railway
```

---

**Result:** Clean sitemap structure with no duplicate URLs and no 404 errors.
