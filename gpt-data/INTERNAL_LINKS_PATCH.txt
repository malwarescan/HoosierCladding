--- CURSOR PATCH: Add Internal Links to Home & Services ---

Files to include (or copy-paste the HTML):
- /includes/home_internal_links.html
- /includes/services_internal_links.html

1) Move the provided files into your project:
   - home_internal_links.html -> /includes/home_internal_links.html
   - services_internal_links.html -> /includes/services_internal_links.html

2) In your Home template (e.g., /views/home.php or index.php), include after the hero:
   <?php include __DIR__ . '/../includes/home_internal_links.html'; ?>

3) In your Services template (e.g., /views/services.php), include near the top:
   <?php include __DIR__ . '/../includes/services_internal_links.html'; ?>

Notes:
- Update the link labels/targets as you add new /matrix/ routes.
- Keep it close to the top of the content to maximize internal equity flow.
