      Understanding when your home insurance covers broken windows is crucial for Indiana homeowners. Coverage depends on the cause of damage, your policy type, and specific circumstances. This guide explains common scenarios and what to expect when filing a claim.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">When Home Insurance Typically Covers Broken Windows</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Most standard homeowners insurance policies cover broken windows when the damage is caused by:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Weather events:</strong> Hail, windstorms, falling tree branches, or ice damage</li>
      <li><strong>Vandalism:</strong> Intentional damage or break-ins</li>
      <li><strong>Fire:</strong> Windows damaged by fire or smoke</li>
      <li><strong>Accidental damage:</strong> Some policies cover accidental breakage, but this varies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">When Coverage May Be Limited or Denied</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Insurance typically does NOT cover:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Normal wear and tear:</strong> Gradual deterioration or aging</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of maintenance:</strong> Damage from deferred repairs</li>
      <li><strong>Intentional damage:</strong> Damage caused by the homeowner</li>
      <li><strong>Flood damage:</strong> Requires separate flood insurance</li>
      <li><strong>Earthquake damage:</strong> Requires separate earthquake coverage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Indiana-Specific Considerations</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Northern Indiana homeowners face unique challenges:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Freeze-thaw cycles:</strong> Ice expansion can crack windows, but coverage depends on whether it's considered sudden damage or gradual deterioration</li>
      <li><strong>Severe storms:</strong> Lake-effect weather can cause wind and hail damage</li>
      <li><strong>Deductibles:</strong> Many policies have separate wind/hail deductibles that may be higher than standard deductibles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Filing a Claim: What to Expect</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If your windows are damaged by a covered event:
    </p>
    
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Document the damage with photos and notes</li>
      <li>Contact your insurance company promptly</li>
      <li>An adjuster will inspect the damage</li>
      <li>You'll receive a claim decision and settlement amount</li>
      <li>You may need to pay your deductible before coverage applies</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Replacement vs. Repair</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Insurance typically covers the cost to repair or replace damaged windows with materials of "like kind and quality." If you choose to upgrade to energy-efficient windows, you'll typically pay the difference out of pocket.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Preventing Window Damage</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      While insurance provides protection, prevention is always better. For Northern Indiana homes:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li>Install storm windows for additional protection</li>
      <li>Trim trees near your home to prevent branch damage</li>
      <li>Maintain window seals and frames to prevent water infiltration</li>
      <li>Consider impact-resistant windows in high-risk areas</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
