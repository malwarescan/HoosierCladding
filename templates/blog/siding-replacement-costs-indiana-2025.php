    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Vinyl siding replacement cost in Indiana</h2>
    <p>
      Vinyl remains the most popular choice in Northern Indiana due to affordability. A full vinyl replacement on a 2,500 sq. ft. home typically costs between $13,750 and $21,250. This price point often includes upgraded trim options and foam insulation backing for energy efficiency.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Fiber cement (James Hardie) siding replacement cost in Indiana</h2>
    <p>
      James Hardie fiber cement offers superior durability against Indiana's freeze-thaw cycles but comes at a premium. Installation is more labor-intensive. Expect to pay 30-50% more than vinyl, with total project costs for a 2,500 sq. ft. home landing between $22,500 and $35,000.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Factors Affecting Cost</h2>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Home Size</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Square footage is the primary cost driver. Most Northern Indiana homes range from 1,200 to 2,500 square feet 
      of siding area. Measure the exterior walls (not floor space) for an accurate estimate.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Material Choice</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Vinyl:</strong> Most affordable, low maintenance, good for Indiana's climate<br>
      <strong>Fiber Cement:</strong> Premium option, excellent durability, handles freeze-thaw cycles<br>
      <strong>Wood:</strong> Beautiful but requires more maintenance in humid Michiana summers
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Existing Siding Removal</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Tear-off and disposal add $1,000-$3,000 to your project. If your home has multiple layers of old siding, 
      expect higher removal costs. Indiana building codes typically limit to two layers maximum.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Insulation Upgrades</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Adding insulated siding or foam board increases costs by $2-4 per square foot but can reduce heating bills 
      by 15-20%—significant savings during harsh South Bend winters.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Trim and Details</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Replacing trim, soffits, and fascia adds $1,500-$4,000 depending on linear footage and material. 
      Hoosier Cladding recommends addressing all exterior envelope components together for best results.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why Invest in Quality Siding?</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li>Lower energy bills (10-20% savings typical)</li>
      <li>Protection from Indiana's freeze-thaw cycles</li>
      <li>Increased home value (70-80% ROI)</li>
      <li>Reduced maintenance costs</li>
      <li>Better curb appeal</li>
      <li>Warranty protection (up to 50 years)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">When to Replace Your Siding</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Consider replacement if you notice:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li>Warped, cracked, or loose panels</li>
      <li>Rising energy bills</li>
      <li>Moisture or rot behind siding</li>
      <li>Fading or peeling (older than 15-20 years)</li>
      <li>Frequent repair needs</li>
      <li>Cold spots or drafts near exterior walls</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      If your siding shows multiple signs of failure or your energy bills have increased significantly, it may be time to consider replacement. 
      Homeowners in South Bend and Northern Indiana should consult with
