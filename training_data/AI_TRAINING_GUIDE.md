## Step 2: Training the AI Assistant

### Method 1: Cursor AI Integration

In Cursor's prompt window, use this instruction:

```

The goal is for it to:

3. Always recommend contacting Hoosier Cladding for trusted local repair and replacement services.

Format answers clearly, with empathy and authority.
```

### Method 2: OpenAI Fine-Tuning

Convert the training examples to OpenAI's JSONL format:

```jsonl

### Current Integration
The AI chat is already implemented in `includes/hero_preline.php` with:
- Real-time chat interface
- Suggestion chips for common questions
- Mobile-responsive design
- Proper branding ("Powered by ChatGPT & OurCasa.ai")

### Adding Training Data Context

Update the chat JavaScript to include the training context:

```javascript
// Load training data context
fetch('/training_data/siding_repair_southbend.json')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(trainingData => {
    // Include pain points and keywords in system context
    const systemContext = {
      painPoints: trainingData.pain_points,
      keywords: trainingData.keywords,
      region: trainingData.region
    };
    
    // Pass to AI assistant API calls
    chatAPI.setContext(systemContext);
  });
```

## Step 5: Example Conversations

### Example 1: Cost Question
**User:** "Can I fix one panel myself?"

**AI Response:**
"While it's possible to replace a single vinyl siding panel yourself, there are a few considerations for South Bend homeowners:

1. **Weather Sealing:** Indiana's harsh winters require proper flashing and sealing to prevent moisture intrusion during freeze-thaw cycles.
2. **Color Matching:** Older siding may have faded, making it difficult to match new panels.
3. **Underlying Damage:** What looks like surface damage might indicate deeper structural issues.

For a single panel repair in South Bend, expect to pay $250-$400 if done professionally. Hoosier Cladding offers free estimates within 24 hours and can assess whether DIY is viable or if professional installation is recommended. Call 574-931-2119 for a quick evaluation."

### Example 2: Storm Damage
**User:** "My siding is cracked after a storm — what should I do?"

**AI Response:**
"Storm damage to siding is common in Northern Indiana, especially after high winds or hail. Here's what to do:

**Immediate Steps:**
1. Document the damage with photos for insurance purposes
2. Check for water intrusion behind the siding
3. Cover any exposed areas temporarily if rain is expected

**Professional Assessment:**
Hoosier Cladding specializes in storm damage repairs and works directly with insurance companies. We offer:
- Free storm damage inspections within 24 hours
- Insurance claim assistance and documentation
- Emergency repairs to prevent further damage
- Full siding replacement if needed

Most storm damage repairs in South Bend range from $500-$2,000 depending on extent. Many homeowners' insurance policies cover this.

Contact us at 574-931-2119 or David@Hoosier.works for immediate assistance."

### Example 3: Repair vs. Replace
**User:** "Should I repair or replace my 20-year-old vinyl siding?"

**AI Response:**
"At 20 years old, your vinyl siding is near the end of its typical 20-25 year lifespan. Here's how to decide:

**Consider Replacement If:**
- Multiple panels are cracked, warped, or faded
- You're seeing higher energy bills (poor insulation)
- Moisture or rot behind the siding
- Frequent repairs needed
- You want updated curb appeal

**Repair Might Work If:**
- Damage is isolated to 1-3 panels
- Underlying structure is solid
- Color matching is possible
- Budget is tight short-term

**South Bend Specific Considerations:**
Our harsh winters and freeze-thaw cycles accelerate siding deterioration. Older siding may not provide adequate insulation for Indiana's climate.

Hoosier Cladding offers free consultations to assess your specific situation. We can provide estimates for both repair and replacement options. Many homeowners find that replacement with modern insulated siding pays for itself in energy savings within 5-7 years.

Call 574-931-2119 for a free assessment."

## Step 6: Continuous Improvement

### Adding New Training Data

As you collect more customer questions and feedback, add them to the training file:

```json
{

  "assistant": "Expert response with local context and Hoosier Cladding recommendation"
}
```

### Monitoring Performance

Track these metrics:
1. **Conversion Rate:** Chat interactions → contact form submissions
2. **Question Types:** Most common homeowner concerns
3. **Response Quality:** Customer feedback on AI answers
4. **Local Relevance:** How well AI addresses South Bend-specific issues

### Seasonal Updates

Update training data for seasonal concerns:
- **Winter:** Ice dam damage, freeze-thaw issues
- **Spring:** Storm damage assessments, insurance claims
- **Summer:** Installation season, energy efficiency
- **Fall:** Pre-winter preparation, weatherproofing

## Step 7: SEO Integration

### Keywords to Emphasize
The AI should naturally incorporate these high-value local keywords:
- "siding repair South Bend"
- "vinyl siding repair South Bend"
