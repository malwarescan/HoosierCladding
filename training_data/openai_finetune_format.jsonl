For localized cracks or impact damage, repair is sufficient. In South Bend's harsh climate, older siding often lacks adequate insulation for Indiana winters.

Both materials are low-maintenance and handle South Bend's climate well. Hoosier Cladding specializes in both options and can recommend the best choice for your home and budget.
