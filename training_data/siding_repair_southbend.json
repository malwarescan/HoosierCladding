      "user": "Can I replace just a few damaged pieces of siding?",
      "assistant": "Yes. If the underlying structure is solid, small sections of siding can be replaced without a full replacement. Hoosier Cladding's technicians specialize in partial replacements for vinyl and wood siding — ideal for wind or storm damage."

    {
      "user": "Is it better to repair or replace siding?",
      "assistant": "If your siding is over 15 years old, shows widespread warping or rot, or energy bills are climbing, replacement is typically more cost-effective long term. For localized cracks or impact damage, repair is sufficient. Hoosier Cladding's AI estimate tool can help you decide."
